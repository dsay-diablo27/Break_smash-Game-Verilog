# Break_smash-Game-Verilog


This project is a Verilog-based implementation of the classic Breakout game, built from scratch for FPGA hardware. The game features a bouncing ball, a movable paddle, and multiple rows of breakable bricks, all rendered in real-time on a VGA display. It runs at a resolution of 640Ã—480 and uses a simple button interface for controlling the paddle. The game includes level transitions, collision detection, and a clean visual layout with walls and paddles. Designed to be both fun and technically insightful, this project helped me deepen my understanding of VGA timing, FSM design, and real-time graphics in digital systems. It was tested on the Nexys A7-100T board and is fully synthesizable.
